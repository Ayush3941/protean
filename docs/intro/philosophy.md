# Protean Philosophy (draft)

Rapid Prototying
Event centric communication
Enabling practices around strategic patterns
Visual representation of the domain
Technology-agnostic domain models

## Constraints

Constaints help give shape to the problem. <Explain why constraints are good.>

- CQRS pattern for the win: All workflows are based on CQRS.
- Communication is only through events
- Event models are the only way to express workflows
- BDD specs are the only way to capture requirements

## Distilling the Problem Domain

Knowledge Crunching is the key.

## Strategic Patterns

Shine a light on aspects that are pivotal in DDD, but receive almost no
attention, like the practices surrounding ubiquitous language, analysis models,
experimentation, and technology agnostic development. 

## Ports and Adapters

Avoid technology decisions and lock-ins by building to an abstraction. And then
powering the abstraction with any technlogy adapter as you see fit.
