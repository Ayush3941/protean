Entities
========

An Entity models an individual thing. Each Entity has a unique identity in that you can distinguish its individuality from among all other Entities of the same or a different type. Many times, perhaps even most times, an Entity will be mutable; that is, its state will change over time. Still, an Entity is not of necessity mutable and may be immutable. The main thing that separates an Entity from other modeling tools is its uniquenessâ€”its individuality.
