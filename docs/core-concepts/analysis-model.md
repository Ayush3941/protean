# Analysis Model

The Analysis Model bridges the gap between the real-world domain and the
software implementation. It acts as a layer of abstraction, capturing the core
concepts and behaviors of the domain without getting bogged down in
technological details.

Incorporating the Analysis Model provides a structured approach to 
understanding and modeling the domain, ensuring that all stakeholders have a 
common language and a shared understanding of the system being built.

## Ubiquitous Language in Action

The Analysis Model is developed collaboratively by domain experts and
developers. It is one of the artifacts that make up the ubiquitous language of 
the domain. The model ensures the business and engineering teams are aligned on 
the domain's terminology, concepts, and behaviors. The Analysis Model translates 
this shared understanding into a technical representation using DDD's tactical 
patterns (like Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, and Repositories), thereby 
serving as a blueprint for the system's design and implementation.

## Standalone and Technology-Agnostic

The Analysis Model should remain independent of implementation aspects such as 
specific technologies and infrastructure choices. This focus on capturing the 
essence of the domain, rather than the details of its implementation, makes the 
Analysis Model a standalone artifact with several benefits:

* **Flexibility:** The technology landscape is constantly evolving. Keeping 
the Analysis Model independent allows you to adapt the implementation to new 
technologies or platforms without altering the core domain understanding.
* **Reusability:** A well-defined Analysis Model becomes a reusable asset. It 
can be a foundation for building multiple applications within the same domain, 
even when using different technical stacks. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The technology-agnostic nature of the model fosters 
clear communication between stakeholders. Domain experts can focus on discussing 
business functionalities, while developers can translate those functionalities 
into code, bridging the gap between business needs and technological
implementation without getting lost in technology-specific jargon.

##  100% Coverage

The Analysis Model should be designed to be testable in isolation from the 
final software implementation. This enables early and frequent verification 
of the domain logic captured in the model, ensuring its integrity and 
correctness before full-scale development begins.

By keeping the Analysis Model independent of underlying technology, it becomes 
100% testable using plain old Python objects. This eliminates the need for mocking 
or performing dependency injection of external systems, allowing for straightforward 
validation of domain logic through unit testing. This approach not only accelerates 
development by identifying and addressing issues early but also enhances the 
maintainability of the codebase by ensuring that domain logic remains separate 
from infrastructure concerns.
