# Value Objects

Value objects are immutable domain elements that are distinguished by their
properties rather than their identity. They are used to represent concepts in
the domain that have no unique identity but are defined by their attributes.

Value objects help to create a rich domain model by encapsulating concepts
that are often represented as simple types.

## Facts

### Value Objects are immutable. { data-toc-label="Immutable" }
Once created, the state of a value object cannot be changed. This immutability
ensures that value objects preserve their integrity and consistency.

### Value Objects are defined by their attributes. { data-toc-label="Data-based definition" }
The identity of a value object is based entirely on its attributes.
Two value objects with the same attribute values are considered equal,
regardless of their instance.

### Value Objects are often used for descriptive purposes. { data-toc-label="Descriptive" }
Value objects are ideal for representing descriptive aspects of the domain,
such as measurements, monetary values, or other concepts that are defined by
their values.

### Value Objects enforce business rules. { data-toc-label="Enclose Business Rules" }
Value objects can encapsulate business rules and constraints related to their
attributes. They ensure that the values they hold are always valid and
consistent.

### Value Objects are nested within entities. { data-toc-label="Enclosed in Entities" }
Value objects are enclosed within aggregates and entities to represent
complex attributes.

### Value Objects are persisted with entities. { data-toc-label="Persisted within Entities" }
Value objects are typically persisted as part of the entities or aggregates
they belong to. Their persistence is managed implicitly through the enclosing
entity or aggregate.

When an entity is persisted, any value objects it contains
are also persisted. This ensures that the complete state of the entity,
including its descriptive attributes, is stored.

### Value Objects can be composed of Value Objects. { data-toc-label="Nesting" }
Value objects can be composed to form complex types, but they do not have
independent identity and are always part of entities or aggregates.

### Value Objects do not reference entities. { data-toc-label="No References" }
Value objects should not hold references to entities. They are self-contained
and defined solely by their attributes.
