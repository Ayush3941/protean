# Connect a concept across multiple domains

Two variations:
- Different concepts with the same name.
- Same concept in multiple domains.

We are talking about the latter here.

A concept can potentially belong to multiple domains.
To connect:
- Use references / Correlation IDs
- Propagate initial event to pass identifier and initialize concept
- Propagate relevant lifecyle changes over events
- Use read models where appropriate
